List of major cities in the world

## Data

The data is extracted from [geonames][geonames], a very exhaustive list of worldwide toponyms.

This [datapackage][datapackage] only list cities above 15,000 inhabitants. Each city is associated with its 
country and subcountry to reduce the number of ambiguities. Subcountry can be the name of a state (eg in 
United Kingdom or the United States of America) or the major administrative section (eg ''region'' in France''). 
See ``admin1`` field on [geonames website][geonames] for further info about subcountry.

Notice that :
* some cities like *Vatican city* or *Singapore* are a whole state so they don't belong to any subcountry. Therefore subcountry is ``N/A``.
* There is no guaranty that a city has a unique name in a country and subcountry (At the time of writing, there are about 60 ambiguities). But for each city, 
the source data primary key ``geonameid`` is provided.
